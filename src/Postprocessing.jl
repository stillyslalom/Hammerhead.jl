Calculates the ratio of the primary peak to the secondary peak in a correlation matrix.

- `correlation_matrix`: The 2D correlation map.
- `peak_location`: A tuple `(row, col)` of the primary peak's integer coordinates.
- `window_size`: An integer defining the size of a square window (e.g., 5 for a 5x5 window)
                 around the primary peak to exclude when searching for the secondary peak.
                 The window will have `window_size รท 2` pixels on each side of the peak.

Returns the ratio `P1 / P2`. If `P2` is zero or very close to zero, returns `Inf`
or a very large number if `P1` is also non-zero, or `NaN` or `0.0` if `P1` is zero.
