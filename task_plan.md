## üöß CRITICAL MISSING FUNCTIONALITY

### Priority 1: Iterative Deformation (ESSENTIAL)
**Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED  
**Criticality**: PRODUCTION BLOCKER

**Missing Implementation**:
- Image deformation based on velocity field estimates
- Iterative refinement with convergence criteria  
- Transform application and validation
- Integration with PIV stage processing

**Impact**: Without iterative deformation, PIV is limited to small displacements and cannot handle complex flows effectively.

### Priority 2: Inter-Stage Guess Propagation (ESSENTIAL)
**Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED  
**Criticality**: PRODUCTION BLOCKER

**Missing Implementation**:
- Velocity field interpolation between grid resolutions
- Initial guess seeding for subsequent stages
- Grid mapping and coordinate transformation
- Multi-stage workflow integration

**Impact**: Multi-stage processing currently runs independent stages instead of progressive refinement, severely limiting accuracy.

### Priority 3: Vector Validation and Replacement (ESSENTIAL)
**Status**: BASIC DETECTION ONLY  
**Criticality**: PRODUCTION BLOCKER

**Missing Implementation**:
- Outlier detection algorithms (median test, normalized residual)
- Vector replacement strategies (interpolation, secondary peaks)
- Quality-based filtering and status management
- Validation workflow integration

**Impact**: No automated quality control means bad vectors contaminate results.
